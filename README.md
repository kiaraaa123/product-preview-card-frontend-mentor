## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries


### What I learned

This challenge gave me an opportunity to practice using media queries. It was a great having the opportunity to practice with them since I've only used them in a few projects so far.


### Continued development

I will continue to practice building responsive websites. I enjoyed the problem-solving that comes with figuring out the best way to format your code to help it transition seamlessly between different screen sizes.
